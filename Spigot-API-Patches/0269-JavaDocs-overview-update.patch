+    <p>Wellspring is designed to give content creators direct access

+        in upstream server platforms (such as Spigot and Paper)

+        <li>To provide new accessibility and options for plugins</li>
+        <li>To remove the need for reflection and version-dependent code</li>
+        <li>To allow access to Minecraft features that Bukkit overlooks</li>
